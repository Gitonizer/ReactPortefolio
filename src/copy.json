    "description": "Hello there! Passionate Software Developer and Engineer, I've learned over the years that the best software solutions begin by us asking the correct questions. Always willing to get my hands dirty, learn and discuss all things related to software and always willing to help, my mission has always been all about solving problems the best way I can. During my professional career, I proudly created, developed and maintained serious games for senior citizens and taught Game design and Unity classes for the bachelor degree I graduated on.",
